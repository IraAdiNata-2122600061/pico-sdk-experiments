# Exploring Raspberry Pi Pico Development with C++ and the Pico SDK

## Overview

This project explores the development process for the **Raspberry Pi Pico** microcontroller using **C++** programming language and the **Pico SDK**. The goal is to provide hands-on experience and understanding of using the Raspberry Pi Pico in embedded systems development, with a focus on leveraging the power of the C++ programming language for efficient and effective code design.

## Features

- **Getting Started**: Setup instructions for the Raspberry Pi Pico development environment.
- **Pico SDK**: Utilize the official **Pico SDK** for building projects and interacting with the hardware.
- **C++ Development**: Writing embedded C++ code for GPIO control, interfacing with sensors, and more.
- **Sample Projects**: Example projects demonstrating core concepts such as blinking LEDs, reading sensors, and working with communication protocols.

## Setup

1. **Install the Pico SDK**:
   Follow the official documentation to set up the **Pico SDK** on your system.  
   (Link to [Pico SDK setup guide](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk))

2. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pico-sdk-experiments.git
   cd pico-sdk-experiments
   ```

3. **Build your project**:
   Follow the steps in the repository to build your project using CMake and the Pico SDK:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. **Upload to the Pico**:
   Use the appropriate method to upload the compiled code to your Raspberry Pi Pico (e.g., drag-and-drop to mass storage mode).

## Example Projects

- **Blinking LED**: Control the onboard LED with a simple loop.
- **Temperature Sensor Interface**: Read data from a temperature sensor and display it on an external display.
